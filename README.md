# Sarcasm-detection-in-Arabic-Language
Sarcasm detection in the Arabic language is a challenging task in the realm of sentiment analysis. With the proliferation of Arabic content on social media platforms, understanding sarcasm becomes pivotal for extracting meaningful insights from user-generated text. This research addresses the scarcity of studies in Arabic sarcasm detection by introducing a model trained on the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset, a resource specifically designed for this purpose. Leveraging state-of-the-art language representation models and data augmentation techniques, the proposed model achieves an F1_Score of 0.65, exhibiting promising performance given the dataset's inherent biases. By employing a pre-trained Arabic BERT-based model, attention mechanisms, and class balancing, our approach demonstrates the potential for effective sarcasm detection in Arabic text, contributing to sentiment analysis and natural language understanding in the Arabic-speaking digital landscape.

## Methodology:
### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for the sarcasm detection task in Arabic text. The following steps were performed to clean and preprocess the raw data:
 	Handling Null Values:
The dataset was checked for any missing values, and none were found in either the training or testing data.
 	Text Cleaning:
To ensure the quality of the text dataset, a series of text cleaning techniques were meticulously applied. Firstly, user mentions and URLs were systematically removed from the text using regular expressions. Subsequently, emojis and emotions were scrupulously eliminated from the text, allowing the analysis to concentrate solely on textual content. In addition, a comprehensive punctuation removal process was carried out, targeting both Arabic and English punctuation marks. Furthermore, Arabic diacritics, including Tashdid and Tanwin, were effectively removed to standardize the text and prepare it for subsequent analysis. These rigorous cleaning steps collectively contributed to the enhancement and consistency of the dataset, facilitating more effective sarcasm detection model training.
 	Text Preprocessing:
Further preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure the text was well-prepared for subsequent analysis. Initially, Arabic stopwords were systematically removed from the text, effectively eliminating common and non-informative words. Additionally, Arabic text underwent stemming, facilitated by the ArabicLightStemmer, which reduced words to their essential root forms, enhancing the uniformity of the dataset. Moreover, to mitigate any inherent biases, the training dataset underwent a random shuffling process. Furthermore, special characters and numerical values were meticulously removed from the text, resulting in a dataset comprised exclusively of textual content. These comprehensive preprocessing measures were instrumental in refining the dataset, ultimately facilitating the development of an effective sarcasm detection model.
These preprocessing steps were crucial in preparing the dataset for subsequent sarcasm detection model training. The clean and standardized data ensures that the model can effectively learn sarcasm patterns from the text.
### Data augmentation
data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the dataset. Specifically, WordNet-based augmentation was employed to generate additional instances of the positive class (sarcasm) to balance the dataset. The following steps were taken:
1.	WordNet Initialization: The Wordnet augmenter was initialized, enabling synonym-based augmentation.
2.	Augmentation Function: A function named augment_text was created to perform data augmentation. It accepts a text input and the number of augmentations to generate.
3.	Augmentation Process: For each instance of the positive class in the training data, the augment_text function was applied to create additional augmented texts (default: 5 augmentations).
4.	Combining Augmented Data: The augmented texts were then combined with the original training data, specifying the label as 1 for all augmented instances to indicate sarcasm.
5.	Balancing the Dataset: To address class imbalance, the training data was balanced by upsampling the minority class (sarcasm) using the resample function. This step resulted in a balanced training dataset, with an equal number of instances for each class.
By applying these data augmentation techniques, the dataset was enriched with additional positive class instances, which contributes to improving model performance and addressing class imbalance issues.
### Build model
A pre-trained Arabic BERT-based model, specifically "aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert," was chosen as the foundation for the sarcasm detection model. The model consists of multiple layers, including an input layer for tokenized text data, an Arabert layer to extract contextual embeddings from the text, an attention layer for capturing important relationships between words, and additional dense and output layers for classification.
The input layer accepts tokenized text sequences of variable length, accommodating different text inputs effectively. The Arabert layer leverages the pre-trained "aubmindlab/bert-base-arabert" model to generate contextualized word embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of words within the context of the entire text. The attention layer enhances the model's understanding of word relationships by applying attention mechanisms to the Arabert embeddings, allowing it to focus on the most rel¬¬evant information. This attention output is then processed through a global average pooling layer, followed by dropout and dense layers for feature extraction and transformation. The final output layer employs a sigmoid activation function to produce binary sarcasm predictions (0 for non-sarcasm and 1 for sarcasm).
The model was trained on a balanced dataset prepared during the data augmentation step. To handle class imbalance, class weights were calculated to ensure that the model appropriately learned from both sarcasm and non-sarcasm instances. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 was used to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss function during training. The training process was executed over ten epochs with a batch size of 16, and a 10% validation split was employed to monitor the model's performance during training.
The resulting trained model can be used to make predictions on new Arabic text data to detect sarcasm effectively
